# StoryVault

A story-preservation web application designed for accessibility and simplicity. Users receive weekly prompts to write stories, which they can save, illustrate with photos, and export as a beautifully formatted PDF.
It allows users to write stories, attach photos, and save them in a personal vault.  
This prototype demonstrates the design and functionality of the app.
